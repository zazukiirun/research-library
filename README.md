# Daft Develop Research Library

Welcome to the Daft Develop research library! This repository is a Next.js project aimed at exploring various technologies such as React components (`react-slick`, `keen-slider`), state management (`zustand`), audio visualization (`wavesurfer.js`), and utility-first CSS framework (`tailwind`).

```bash

Technologies Used
1. React Slick
React Slick is a carousel component built with React. It is easy to use and customizable, making it perfect for creating sliders and carousels in React applications.

2. Keen Slider
Keen Slider is a lightweight (less than 10kb gzipped) slider library with a focus on performance and flexibility. It offers smooth transitions and touch support out of the box.

3. Zustand
Zustand is a minimalistic yet powerful state management library for React. It provides a simple API for managing global state in your application without the need for complex setups like Redux.

4. WaveSurfer.js
WaveSurfer.js is a customizable audio visualization library that can be used to create interactive audio waveforms. It supports various audio formats and offers features like zooming, panning, and waveform styling.

5. Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes for building custom designs without writing custom CSS. It promotes a highly responsive and scalable design system.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
